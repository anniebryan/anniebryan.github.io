        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

        <p>Hi! My name is Annie Bryan, and I'm a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). I just graduated from
          MIT with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics.</p>

        <p>My sophomore year of college, I spent a lot of time applying to SWE internships and preparing for interviews. 
          It was a stressful process to say the least, and many interviews did <em>not</em> go as well as they could have.</p>

        <p>After dozens of technical interviews and online assessments, I've developed a comprehensive guide to everything
          I used while I was studying for these interviews. This preparation led to offers from Facebook and a few other
          big tech companies, and I evem passed the technical round of the Google application process.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, I've tutored several MIT undergraduate students in data structures, algorithms, and interview prep.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-this-course">What is this course?</h2>

        <p>This course is a guide to everything I used when I was studying for technical interviews. It covers the bulk of 
          the technical material that would be reasonably expected of someone applying to a software engineering role.</p>

        <p>This course includes the theory as well as practical examples and walkthroughs of practice problems. It's important
          to know the background behind why something works, but it's also important to be able to apply the concept!</p>

        <h2 id="what-will-this-course-teach-me">What will this course teach me?</h2>

        <p>This course will teach you all you need to know to nail your next coding interview and land a job as a SWE 
          for a FAANG company. Here are some examples of what you'll learn.</p>

        <h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>

        <p>After you write any algorithm or data structure, you'll likely be asked about its time and space complexity.</p>

        <p>This section will cover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Big-O notation</li>
          <li>The runtime of common algorithms</li>
          <li>Determining the time and space complexity of any algorithms or data structures you develop</li>
          <li>Knowing if a runtime is amortized, expected-case, or worst-case</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additionally, this section will cover some more advanced topics that are less likely to show up in an interview,
          but are nonetheless important fundamentals to know as a SWE:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complexity classes such as P, NP, NP-Hard, and NP-Complete</li>
          <li>Reductions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>

        <p>Coding interviews often require a data structure to be sorted, so it's crucial to know the runtime of a few sorting
          algorithms, and to be able to implement them. This section will cover the following sorting algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Merge sort</li>
          <li>Quick sort</li>
          <li>Radix sort</li>
          <li>Insertion sort</li>
          <li>Heap sort</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>

        <p>Data structures are the bread and butter of coding interviews. It's important to be familiar with these,
          as optimized solutions to many advanced questions will involve one or more. This section will cover the 
          following data structures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrays</li>
          <li>Sets</li>
          <li>Hash Tables</li>
          <li>Stacks and Queues</li>
          <li>Linked Lists</li>
          <li>Trees, AVLs, Tries, Heaps, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="graph-algorithms">Graph Algorithms</h3>

        <p>Lots of problems can be abstracted by converting it to a graph and applying well-known graph algorithms
          such as those to find a path of minimum distance, determine connectivity, or detect cycles.</p>
        
        <p>This section will cover the pros and cons of the different ways to represent a graph in memory:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object and pointers</li>
          <li>Adjacency matrix</li>
          <li>Edge list</li>
          <li>Adjacency map</li>
        </ul>

        <p>the basic graph traversal algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breadth-first search (BFS)</li>
          <li>Depth-first search (DFS)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>some common algorithms for single-source shortest path (SSSP):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Directed acyclic graph shortest path (DAGSP)</li>
          <li>Dijkstra's</li>
          <li>Bellman-Ford</li>
        </ul>

        <p>algorithms for determining connectivity, detecting cycles, and other useful graph problem strategies.</p>

        <h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h3>

        <p>Many advanced interview questions can be solved recursively using dynamic programming. This section will
          cover the 5 steps I learned in my college
          <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/">algorithms course</a>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>S</strong>ubproblem</li>
          <li><strong>R</strong>elation</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>ase case</li>
          <li><strong>S</strong>olution</li>
          <li><strong>T</strong>ime (run time)</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p>The best method of getting comfortable with DP problems is to practice, so this section also includes several 
          practice problems with example solutions.</p>

        <h2 id="who-should-use-this-course">Who should use this course?</h2>

        <p>This course is targeted to anyone applying for a software engineering (SWE) internship or full-time position. 
          This course will be most useful to you if you already know Python or JavaScript, as my tutorials and practice 
          examples will be written in one or both of those languages.</p>

        <h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h2>

        <p>There are lots of other great resources you can use to prepare for a coding interview. Here are a few:</p>

        <ul>
